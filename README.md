# Design of Cyber-Physical Systems in Manufacturing

## Course Overview

The goal of this course is to integrate practical and theoretical aspects in an international and interdisciplinary setting. Participants will engage in the design, development, and deployment of a **cyber-physical system (CPS)** for manufacturing, working collaboratively in teams to build a **digital twin** for a set of robots using MATLAB Simulink. The course emphasizes both simulation and real-world implementation, providing hands-on experience with industrial series production and robot commissioning.
